 I'm Leandro
- 📌 Buenos Aires, Argentina

- 🖥️ I am a self-taught Front-End oriented web developer.

- 🔎 I am currently searching for React positions

- ⚡ I characterize myself as a dedicated, proactive, responsible, and solid person to meet objectives. Eager to be able to offer my knowledge in a work environment, and to be able to develop me in a team.

- 📚 I consider that the path of learning is infinite, so I find myself with the personal objective of, in addition to consolidating the mentioned technologies, learning TypeScript.

- 💞️ In this GitHub, I will be going up projects practicing Material UI, Styled Components, Hook React Forms, Context, Redux, etc
